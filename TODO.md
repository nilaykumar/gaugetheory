- Finish the proof on associated fiber bundles, specialize to vector bundles, consider the adjoint bundle
- Add a section on the space of connections, adjoint bundle
- Finish the curvature section
    - Prove the second Bianchi identity
- Discuss local quantities (pullbacks of connections and curvature)
    - Prove basic properties
